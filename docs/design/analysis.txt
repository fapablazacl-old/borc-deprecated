
Project Definition Analysis

1. Project:
	- It's the main entity in the build description file.
	- Has a collection of many targets, tasks, and configurations.
	
2. Target:
	- Is a software artifact that has to be explicity generated by the build manager.
	- Has a Name and a Version.
		- The Name is a Identifier-Like value.
		- The Version is a Semantic Versioning value [TODO: other versioning schemes? how their affect us?]
	- Has dependencies:
		- Those dependencies can be defined in the same project, or defined externally and imported.
			- When defined internally (locally), are specified in detail in the same project.
			- When defined externally:
				- Their definitions exists outside the project.
				- Their contents can be fetched from a path, a url or a repository.
				- Can be built as part of the project build proccess.
				- Can be pre-built and used directly in the project build proccess.
		- Can be run-time or build-time dependencies:
			- A run-time dependency is a Module that is necesary when the user is running the program or another run-time based library dependency.
			- A build-time dependency is a Module that is necesary when the developer are building the program or library.
	- Has a type:
		- program: The Target is a executable module.
		- library: The Target is a library that can be a dependency for another program or library.
		- [TODO] documentation:
	
3. Task:
	- Is a set of steps to acomplish some objetive.
	- Some default tasks are:
		- build: Build a set of targets.
		- clean: Clean all the intermediate objects generated for a build.
		- install: Installs all the targets to a pre-configured location.
		- run: Executes the specified executable target.
			- When no executable is specified, the default executable is executed.	
	- Tasks can be developer-defined 
		- [TODO]: Define the custom task definition format-language, etc.
		
4. Configuration
	- Is a set of properties that drive the way different variations of the artifacts can be defined.
	- By default, exists the Debug and Release configurations:
		- The Debug Configuration is a configuration suitable for development.
		- The Release Configuration is a configuration suitable for production/deployment.

		
Workflow Definition (Users Histories)
	- As a [Developer] I want to [generate a skeleton project] In order to [automatize the development].
	- As a [Developer] I want to [build a project] In order to [test the project], [ship the project], [pack the project].
	
	
Project Instantiation Analysis (Developer Perspective) [TODO: Please define]
	- Project Instantiation is when the developer issues the following command:
		$ borc init hello-world 
		$ cd hello-world
		$ borc gen target --type=library --lang=cpp17 compute-fft
		$ bocc gen target --type=program --lang=python
		$ borc configure
