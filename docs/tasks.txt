=================================================
First Iteration (MVP): 
=================================================
- Develop the minimal core of the build system
    - Define the classes of the content of the project and its targets, properly, in order to be buildable.
        - [OK] Independent of the Toolchain used.
        - [OK] Independent of the Programming Language used.
        - [OK] Must express the dependency relationships between targets.
        - [OK] Model the current BORC project structure for testing purposes.

    - Define the classes needed to express toolchains
        - The toolchains holds information about the available:
            - Compilers, Linkers and Generators used.

    - Define the classes needed for generate the tasks neccesary in order to build the project
        - Need A toolchain and a Project
        - Must express the dependency relationships between the building of those tasks

    - Define the classes needed for execute those tasks
        - Must support the build proccess in serial and in parallel.

    - Define the classes neeed for running the executable targets of the project
        - Must add to the path environment variable the locations of the runtime-dependencies
        - Dependens on the Project Model.

- Develop the main command line tool of the build system
